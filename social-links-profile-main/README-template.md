### What I learned

Thank you frontend mentor for giving me this opportunity. I have leanrt a lot from this challenge especially my CSS knowledge on Flexbox and I mean CSS in general.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
